# Emerging-Sys-Arch-Tech

# Project Summary

The thermostat project is designed to provide a simple and smart solution for temperature management. It allows users to monitor and adjust the temperature in their environment, with the added ability to connect to the internet for remote control. By integrating hardware peripherals like buttons, lights, and temperature sensors, the system ensures smooth operation and easy interaction for users. This project addresses the problem of efficient and accessible temperature control, making it suitable for a variety of applications.

# What Was Done Well

One of the strengths of this project was the successful integration of multiple hardware components to create a cohesive system. The use of GPIO for buttons and LEDs, I2C for sensor communication, and UART for data feedback ensured that each part of the system worked together seamlessly. Additionally, the code was designed to be modular and easy to understand, making it easier to debug and expand in the future. The periodic task scheduling was implemented effectively, ensuring that the system remained responsive and efficient.

# Areas for Improvement

While the project successfully met its goals, there are areas where it could be improved. For example, the cloud connectivity features could be expanded to include a user-friendly mobile app or web interface. Additionally, more robust error handling could be implemented to manage unexpected issues with sensors or communication. Optimizing the energy efficiency of the system could also be explored, particularly for long-term use in IoT applications.

# Tools and Resources Added to the Support Network

This project utilized several essential tools and resources, including:

Texas Instruments (TI) development tools and libraries for hardware integration.

Online resources and documentation for understanding the GPIO, I2C, UART, and Timer functionalities.

Collaboration with peers and online forums for troubleshooting and enhancing the project design.

The use of draw.io for creating clear and simple task scheduler diagrams.

These tools and resources will remain valuable for future projects and professional development.

 # Transferable Skills

The skills gained from this project are highly transferable to other projects and coursework. These include:
Understanding hardware-software integration and working with microcontrollers.
Implementing task scheduling and periodic updates in embedded systems.
Writing clean and modular code to enhance maintainability and readability.
Troubleshooting hardware communication issues, such as those encountered with I2C sensors and UART connections.
Making the Project Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable
Several strategies were used to ensure the project remains maintainable, readable, and adaptable:
Modular Design: The code was broken down into separate functions for initializing peripherals, reading data, and controlling outputs. This makes it easier to update or replace individual components without affecting the entire system.
Clear Documentation: Comments were included throughout the code to explain the purpose of each section, aiding future developers in understanding the implementation.
Flexible Architecture: The use of standardized protocols (I2C, UART) and widely supported hardware ensures that the system can be easily adapted or expanded to include new features.
Error Handling: Basic error messages were implemented, and additional safeguards were considered to ensure the system behaves predictably in unexpected situations.
This approach not only solved the immediate problem but also provided a solid foundation for future enhancements and applications.
